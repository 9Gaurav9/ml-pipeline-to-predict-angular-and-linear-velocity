# ml-pipeline-to-predict-angular-and-linear-velocity
Developed an ML pipeline to predict a robot's angular (Cmd_vel_w) and linear velocity (Cmd_vel_v) using XGBoost, Random Forest, and Ridge Regression. The project included preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation with MSE and RÂ² scores, ensuring accurate predictions for autonomous navigation.
